# üöÆ Smart Waste Segregation System using YOLOv8

Welcome to the Smart Waste Segregation System! This project leverages the power of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to automate and optimize the process of waste classification and segregation.

---

## üåü Project Overview

The Smart Waste Segregation System is designed to:
- **Detect and classify waste** Detecting the waste and classifying into recyclable, hazardious and desposable in real time using computer vision.
- **Automate sorting** for improved recycling efficiency and reduced human intervention.
- **Enable scalability** for smart cities, waste management facilities, and eco-friendly initiatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** (core logic and scripting)
- **YOLOv8** (object detection and classification)
- **OpenCV** (image processing)
- **Streamlit** (User Interface)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUGVEDADHIKARI/Smart-Waste-Segregation-System-using-Yolov8.git
cd Smart-Waste-Segregation-System-using-Yolov8
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download YOLOv8 Weights

- Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights or train your own model.
- Place the weights file in the appropriate directory (specify path if needed).

### 4. Run the System

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
